== Description ==
**obsocialbookmarker** is a social bookmarking plugin which adds user-submission links at the bottom of each post for various social bookmarking sites which allows your visitors to easily submit them in a number of social bookmarking sites.

Bookmarks of your choice and position of bookmarks can be configured from the options page. 

Installation is as simple as copy and paste and in case of upgradation simple as overwriting the old files.No need to touch your template or anything.

You have the option to choose which bookmarks you want to enabled, and in what positions.

I have tried my best to make installation as simple as possible without sacrificing any usability.
