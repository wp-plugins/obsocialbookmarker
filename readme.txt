== Description ==

obsocialbookmarker is a social bookmarking plugin which adds user-submission links at the bottom of each post for various social bookmarking sites which allows your visitors to easily submit them in a number of social bookmarking sites.

Bookmarks of your choice and position of bookmarks can be configured from the options page. 

Installation is as simple as copy and paste and in case of upgradation simple as overwriting the old files.No need to touch your template or anything.

You have the option to choose which bookmarks you want to enabled, and in what positions.

I have tried my best to make installation as simple as possible without sacrificing any usability.

== Installation ==

**Installation**
1. Upload 'obsocialbookmarker' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "Options"->"obsocialbookmarker" and you will have choice to do following two things
	a.	Tick the position where you want to show the Bookmarks.
	b.	Tick the Bookmarks which you want to show.

**Upgradation**
Upgradation where old version is less than version 5 and new version which you want to install is version 5 or greater
1.	Don't deactivate the plugin, very important if you want to preserve old configuration.
2.	Delete the 'obsocialbookmarker.php' in the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
3.	Upload 'obsocialbookmarker' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

Thats it, you are ready to rock!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*Why images are not within plugin?

I deliberately didn't added images to make installation easy. Bookmark icon are fetch either from original site or plugin parent site.
